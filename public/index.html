        <h1>Danganengine</h1>
        <p>This demo should work fine in any modern navigator, but it's not guaranteed since it's just a pre alpha. The sprites, the courtroom, the game HUD and the camera movements are customizable, and the whole script is read in realtime from a JSON file.</p>
        <p>I'll go to the point. The objective for this is offer a module package to be able to make more than just that demo. With the right code, it would be easy make a chat application to RP class trials in a near-game environment, or program a story in game format.</p>
        <p>I started working in this 2 years ago, but only for a few weeks a year. A month ago I decided to take it more seriously and apply some things I've learned in these 2 years, node.js and modules specifically. As I said earlier, the project is currently in prealpha so the code will change. The project is <a href="https://github.com/frabarz/dangan-engine">hosted on github</a> if you want to follow the development. I'm still an amateur, so if anyone want to report bugs or send pull requests, you're welcome to.</p>

        <h3>Distribution</h3>
        <p>Most of the resources to make this demo work are copyright from the game's developer, so I can't distribute them in this repo. However, if you can get them from other sources, this is the tree structure that makes it work:</p>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/discussion/">Normal discussion phase</a></li>
            <li><a href="/nsd/">Non-Stop Debate [not available yet]</a></li>
            <li><a href="/logicdive/">Logic Dive [Concept test]</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Building</h3>
        <p>The project is being developed with ES6 javascript, in hopes to port it to TypeScript in the future.</p>
        <p>If you want to make modifications to the source, you have to re-build it using gulp. You must have nodejs installed.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open a terminal in the root folder of the project.</li>
            <li>Execute <code>npm install</code> to get the required node_modules.</li>
            <li>Execute <code>gulp pack</code> to rebuild the discussion example.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In case gulp is not working, check if <code>gulp-cli</code> is correctly installed in you global environment.</p>
        <p>You can check the gulpfile.js in the root folder for other methods to build other examples.</p>
